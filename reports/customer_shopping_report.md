# Customer Shopping Behavior Analysis

## Objective
Analyze customer shopping behavior to understand spending patterns, category performance, and discount impact.

## Dataset
Source: Kaggle – Customer Shopping Trends Dataset  
Kaggle notebook: https://www.kaggle.com/code/shreyalanand98/eda-project-1

## Methodology
- Standardized column names and checked missing values
- Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Compared spending by gender, category revenue, discount impact, and age vs spending

## Key Findings
- Spending is relatively consistent across age groups (age alone is not a strong predictor).
- A small number of categories contribute disproportionately to total revenue.
- Discounts influence purchasing behavior but do not always increase purchase amount.

## Business Recommendations
- Prioritize high-performing categories for inventory and marketing.
- Use targeted discounts rather than blanket promotions.
- Segment customers using behavior and category preferences, not age alone.

## Tools Used
Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
