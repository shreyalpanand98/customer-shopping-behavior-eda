        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>
          This project explores customer shopping behavior using exploratory
          data analysis (EDA) to understand spending patterns, revenue-driving
          categories, and the role of discounts.

          <h3>Key Insight</h3>
          <p>
            This visualization shows the mean purchase amount
            grouped by gender, allowing for a comparison of central tendency
            across demographic segments.
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Observation:</strong>
                The average purchase amounts for male and female customers are
                nearly identical, with only a marginal difference between the two
                groups. The overlap suggests low effect size, indicating that gender
                does not meaningfully explain variance in purchase amount.</li>
                <br/>
                <li><strong>Interpretation:</strong>
                Because the central tendency is similar across
                genders, gender alone appears to have limited predictive power for
                purchase value in this dataset. Any observed difference is likely
                outweighed by other factors such as product category, purchasing
                context, or discount application.</li>
                <br/>
                <li><strong>Implication for modeling / decision-making:</strong>
                Gender may be better
                utilized as a secondary or interaction feature rather than a primary
                driver in predictive models or segmentation strategies. Feature
                combinations involving behavioral variables are likely to yield
                stronger explanatory and predictive performance.</li>

        <h2>Revenue by Product Category</h2>

          A small number of product categories contribute disproportionately to
          total revenue, highlighting key focus areas for business strategy.

          <h3>Key Insight</h3>
          <p>
            This visualization shows the total revenue aggregated by product category, highlighting how revenue contribution varies across categories.
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Observation:</strong>
                Revenue distribution across categories is highly skewed, with a small subset of categories accounting for a disproportionately large share of total revenue. The leading category generates significantly more revenue than the remaining categories, indicating an uneven contribution pattern.</li>
                <br/>
                <li><strong>Interpretation:</strong>
                The skewed distribution suggests a Pareto-like effect, where a minority of product categories drive the majority of revenue. Lower-revenue categories contribute marginally in comparison, which may reflect differences in demand, pricing, purchase frequency, or product availability..</li>
                <br/>
                <li><strong>Implication for modeling / decision-making:</strong>
                Product category emerges as a high-impact explanatory feature and should be prioritized in downstream modeling and segmentation efforts. From a business perspective, optimizing inventory, pricing, and promotions for top-performing categories is likely to yield a higher return on investment than uniformly distributing resources across all categories.</li>

        <h2>Discount Impact on Spending</h2>

          Box plots are used to compare purchase amounts when discounts are
          applied versus not applied.

          <h3>Key Insight</h3>
          <p>
            This box plot compares the distribution of purchase amounts for transactions where a discount was applied versus those without a discount, using median, interquartile range (IQR), and overall spread.
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Observation:</strong>
                The median purchase amount is approximately the same for discounted and non-discounted transactions. Both groups exhibit similar interquartile ranges and overall dispersion, with comparable minimum and maximum values.</li>
                <br/>
                <li><strong>Interpretation:</strong>
                The substantial overlap in distributions suggests that applying a discount does not materially increase purchase amount on a per transaction basis. While discounts may influence purchase likelihood or conversion rates, their effect on spending magnitude appears limited in this dataset.</li>
                <br/>
                <li><strong>Implication for modeling / decision-making:</strong>
                Discount application alone may have low marginal explanatory power for predicting purchase amount. In predictive models, discount status should likely be combined with other contextual features such as product category, customer segment, or purchase frequency to capture meaningful interactions. From a business perspective, this supports the use of targeted, behavior - aware discount strategies rather than uniform discounting.</li>

          amount, suggesting age alone is not a strong predictor of spending.

          <h3>Key Insight</h3>
          <p>
            This scatter plot visualizes the relationship between customer age and purchase amount, allowing assessment of correlation, spread, and potential age-driven spending patterns.
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Observation:</strong>
                Purchase amounts are widely distributed across all age groups, with no visible upward or downward trend. High and low purchase values appear at nearly every age, indicating substantial overlap across the age range.</li>
                <br/>
                <li><strong>Interpretation:</strong>
                The absence of a discernible trend suggests little to no linear correlation between age and purchase amount. Age, as an isolated demographic variable, does not explain meaningful variance in spending behavior within this dataset.</li>
                <br/>
                <li><strong>Implication for modeling / decision-making:</strong>
                Age is likely to have low standalone predictive value in regression or classification models targeting purchase amount. It may be more effective as part of interaction terms or nonlinear transformations when combined with behavioral features such as product category, purchase frequency, or discount usage. From a business standpoint, this supports shifting focus from age-based segmentation toward behavior-driven personalization strategies.</li>
